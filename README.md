# K-Nearest-Neighbor Algorithm

#### Project delves into implementing the K-Nearest-Neighbor Algorithm by fitting and predicting target attributes via making testing and training data sets for k-fold cross validations and 1-NN Algorithims using Python libraries and custom Python classes!

#### While we will be working with the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm in various ways, we will also implement methods for data pre-processing, debugging, model evaluation, normalization, standardization, and visualization to create, evaluate, and optimize a data mining algorithm as applied to a real-world dataset.
